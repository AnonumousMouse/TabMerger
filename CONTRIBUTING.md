### Pull Request Process

1. Update the <a href="https://github.com/lbragile/TabMerger/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a> file with details of changes you've made. Be as detailed as possible. Further explanation of reasoning/logic that does not fit in the README file, should go as a comment in the Pull Request.
2. Adjust the version number in `manifest.json` using the <a href="https://semver.org/">SemVer</a> versioning scheme.
3. Continuous Integration (CI) is added to automate the PR process. Make sure you have tested your added functionality to ensure code coverage thresholds are met. Otherwise, your PR will be automatically rejected.
4. Once your PR passes the CI check and is reviewed by me, I will either accept it as is (and merge it in) or ask you to make corrections.
