### Merges your tabs into one location to save memory usage and increase your productivity.

## Description

Tired of searching through squished tab icons to find that one tab you are sure is there?
With TabMerger you can simplify this clutter while greatly increasing productivity in a highly organized and customizable fashion!

With a single click, you can have all your tabs in a single place, where you can then re-arrange them into appropriate groups, delete extra/unwanted tabs, customize group colors, and so much more. All tabs that are merged into TabMerger are stored internally for you to use at a later time, even when you close the browser window. Lots of analytics are provided to keep you informed about the state of your tabs.

In addition to reducing the heavy tab clutter, TabMerger significantly reduces the memory usage of your machine as on average each chrome tab can use 25MB-100MB of RAM. These add up quickly if left open and can significantly slow down your machine, but with TabMerger you simply have a list of tabs which can be re-opened when you really need them.

## TODO

- [ ] Integrate syncing across devices with Chrome Storage API.
- [ ] Make available on other browsers such as firefox, microsoft edge, etc.
- [ ] Move global merge button within groups. This will allow a user to merge tabs directly into a group rather than always into the top group (`id: group-0`).
- [ ] Implement search functionality (group search to filter groups & tab search to filter within a group for a specific tab).
- [ ] Major refactoring to simplify the logic and avoid redundant reloading of the page.
